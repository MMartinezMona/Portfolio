            <h1>vLex Knowledge Base</h1>

            <p>In 2021, I supported the renovation of their <a href="https://support.vlex.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Knowledge Base</a> website.</p>

                        This project consisted of starting the knowledge base for the company to share with users. The project started from an old and outdated manual. The main change proposed in this project was to change it from feature-based to a more user-friendly approach. This is reflected in the "Getting started" and the "How-to guides" sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>‚ùóI have not been part of this project for a couple of years now, and it has evolved on its own. I was not involved in the creation of the videos, but the ideas I proposed can still be seen throughout the knowledge base.</p>
