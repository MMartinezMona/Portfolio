                    Take a look at this image. It may appear static because the
                    ball is not being held by anything, it's just... there,
                    floating in space. So, unless this is a game where gravity
                    does not exist, or this is meant to be a floating ball, it
                    should fall to the ground. It has no mass nor weight! It
                    just seems unrealistic.

        <p>
            Objects are bound by physics. This concept does not mean that every
            game needs to have earthly physics, I have enjoyed 3D experiences
            where gravity is less than it is on Earth! However, there is always
            a set of rules, defined as the physics engine. For the sake of
            simplicity, let's consider the yellow circle is a ball on Earth, it
            should be affected by gravity, wind, and other objects. However, in
            the previous image we have a nonchalant circle without earthly
            worries like falling.
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a 3D environment, objects are not instantly bound by
            earthly worries but need to be added the properties.&nbsp;In Unity,
            we add a Rigidbody component to GameObjects. Objects with the
            Rigidbody component can receive forces and torque to move in a
            realistic way, influenced by gravity, other forces, and interacting
            with other objects.
        </p>

            <div class="column2"
            <p>
            This is now a ball with a Rigidbody component. The ball is indeed
            affected by gravity, therefore it falls on the ground and bounces.
            Even though it is just a yellow circle, adding a Rigidbody makes it
            look more like a real object, an actual bouncing ball.
            </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            However, it does not yet interact with the side wall, it just
            continues like there's nothing there, this is due to the lack of
            Colliders.
        </p>
        <h4 id="-to-make-objects-interact-with-each-other-we-use-colliders">
            ❗ To make objects interact with each other, we use
            <strong>Colliders</strong>.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Collision are components that must be added alongside the Rigidbody
            to allow objects to interact with each other. In the previous
            example, the ball does not collide with the wall because, even
            though it has the Rigidbody component, we still have not added
            Colliders, it simply passes the wall like it did not exist.
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="column2"

                <p>
            Now the ball has Rigidbody and Collider components. Now it interacts
            with the wall, it bounces off of it and moves to the left, as it
            would in real life. Again, it is a simple yellow circle, but the way
            it moves and interacts with the world and other objects makes it
            look more realistic, more natural. Imagine what you can achieve with
            more elements.

            To finish this topic, think of a time when you saw a video or
            experienced a game that had something off with the physics. I don't
            mean like dream sequences with strange gravity or people flying. I
            mean times when you see a wimpy plant that can stand against a car
            going at full speed. What did you think about the game then?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following unit you will learn how to give a Rigidbody and
            colliders to your GameObjects in order to create realistic physics.
