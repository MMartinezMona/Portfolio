                        Take a look at this image. It may appear static because
                        the ball is not being held by anything, it's just...
                        there, floating in space. So, unless this is a game
                        where gravity does not exist, or this is meant to be a
                        floating ball, it should fall to the ground. It has no
                        mass nor weight! It just seems unrealistic.
                    </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                Objects are bound by physics. This concept does not mean that
                every game needs to have earthly physics, I have enjoyed 3D
                experiences where gravity is less than it is on Earth! However,
                there is always a set of rules, defined as the physics engine.
                For the sake of simplicity, let's consider the yellow circle is
                a ball on Earth, it should be affected by gravity, wind, and
                other objects. However, in the previous image we have a
                nonchalant circle without earthly worries like falling.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating a 3D environment, objects are not instantly bound
                by earthly worries but need to be added the properties.&nbsp;In
                Unity, we add a Rigidbody component to GameObjects. Objects with
                the Rigidbody component can receive forces and torque to move in
                a realistic way, influenced by gravity, other forces, and
                interacting with other objects.
            </p>
            <div class="grid">

                        This is now a ball with a Rigidbody component. The ball
                        is indeed affected by gravity, therefore it falls on the
                        ground and bounces. Even though it is just a yellow
                        circle, adding a Rigidbody makes it look more like a
                        real object, an actual bouncing ball.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, it does not yet interact with the side wall, it just
                continues like there's nothing there, this is due to the lack of
                Colliders.
            </p>
            <h2>Colliders</h2>
            <div class="example">
                <h4>
                    ❗ To make objects interact with each other, we use
                    <strong>Colliders</strong>.
                </h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                Collision are components that must be added alongside the
                Rigidbody to allow objects to interact with each other. In the
                previous example, the ball does not collide with the wall
                because, even though it has the Rigidbody component, we still
                have not added Colliders, it simply passes the wall like it did
                not exist.
            </p>
            <div class="grid">
                <div class="span-two-columns">
                    <p>
                        Now the ball has Rigidbody and Collider components. Now
                        it interacts with the wall, it bounces off of it and
                        moves to the left, as it would in real life. Again, it
                        is a simple yellow circle, but the way it moves and
                        interacts with the world and other objects makes it look
                        more realistic, more natural. Imagine what you can
                        achieve with more elements.

                To finish this topic, think of a time when you saw a video or
                experienced a game that had something off with the physics. I
                don't mean like dream sequences with strange gravity or people
                flying. I mean times when you see a wimpy plant that can stand
                against a car going at full speed. What did you think about the
                game then?
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following unit you will learn how to give a Rigidbody and
                colliders to your GameObjects in order to create realistic
                physics.
